This is not the same as the boundary operator for a cell complex.\n\n# Example\n\n```javascript\nvar bnd = require('boundary-cells')\n\nconsole.log(bnd([\n  [0, 1, 2],\n  [2, 1, 3]\n]))\n```\n\n# Install\n\n```\nnpm i boundary-cells\n```\n\n# API\n\n#### `require('boundary-cells')(cells)`\nExtracts the boundary of all cells in a cell complex\n\n* `cells` is a cell complex\n\n**Returns** An array of all boundary cells in the complex\n\nCredits\n=======\n(c) 2013-2015 Mikola Lysenko.
