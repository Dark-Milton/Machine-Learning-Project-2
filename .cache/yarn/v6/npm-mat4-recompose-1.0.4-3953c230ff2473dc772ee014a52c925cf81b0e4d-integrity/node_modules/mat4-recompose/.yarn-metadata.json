This is commonly used in matrix animations (i.e. after [decompose](https://github.com/mattdesl/mat4-decompose) and interpolation). Code ported from [W3 CSS Spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/#decomposing-a-3d-matrix). PRs for more tests/robustness/optimizations welcome. \n\nYou may also be interested in [mat4-interpolate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mat4-interpolate), [mat4-decompose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mat4-decompose), and [css-mat4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-mat4).\n\n## Usage\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/mat4-recompose.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/mat4-recompose/)\n\n#### `recompose(matrix, translation, scale, skew, perspective, quaternion)`\n\nRecomposes a matrix with the given vectors, storing the result into `matrix` (a 16 float array). \n\n- `translation` [x, y, z]\n- `scale` [x, y, z]\n- `skew` [xy, xz, yz] skew factors\n- `perspective` [x, y, z, w]\n- `quaternion` [x, y, z, w]\n\nReturns the `matrix` being recomposed.\n\nBuilds a translation matrix, then applies the quaternion rotation and perspective. The matrix is then multiplied by YZ shear, then XZ shear, then XY shear (if they are non-zero). Finally multiplied by scale to get the resulting recomposed matrix.\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/mattdesl/mat4-recompose/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
