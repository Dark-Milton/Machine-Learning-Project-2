    "readme": "# TinySDF\n\nTinySDF is a tiny and fast JavaScript library for generating SDF (signed distance field)\nfrom system fonts on the browser using Canvas 2D and\n[Felzenszwalb/Huttenlocher distance transform](https://cs.brown.edu/~pff/papers/dt-final.pdf).\nThis is very useful for [rendering text with WebGL](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/text-signed-distance-fields/).\n\nThis implementation is based directly on the algorithm published in the Felzenszwalb/Huttenlocher paper, and is not a port of the existing C++ implementation provided by the paper's authors.\n\nDemo: http://mapbox.github.io/tiny-sdf/\n\n## Usage\nCreate a TinySDF for drawing SDFs based on font parameters:\n\n```js\nvar fontsize = 24; // Font size in pixels\nvar buffer = 3;    // Whitespace buffer around a glyph in pixels\nvar radius = 8;    // How many pixels around the glyph shape to use for encoding distance\nvar cutoff = 0.25  // How much of the radius (relative) is used for the inside part the glyph\n\nvar fontFamily = 'sans-serif'; // css font-family\nvar fontWeight = 'normal';     // css font-weight\nvar tinySDFGenerator = new TinySDF(fontsize, buffer, radius, cutoff, fontFamily, fontWeight);\n\nvar oneSDF = tinySDFGenerator.draw('泽');\n// returns a Uint8ClampedArray array of alpha values (0–255) for a size x size square grid\n\n// To generate glyphs with variable advances (e.g. non-ideographic glyphs),\n// use `drawWithMetrics`\nvar sdfWithMetrics = tinySDFGenerator.drawWithMetrics('A');\n// sdfWithMetrics.data is the same as in `draw`, except the size may be clipped to fit the glyph\n// sdfWithMetrics.metrics contains:\n//  top:        Maximum ascent of glyph from alphabetic baseline\n//  left:       Currently hardwired to 0 (actual glyph differences are encoded in the rasterization)\n//  width:      Width of rasterized portion of glyph\n//  height\n//  advance:    Layout advance\n//  sdfWidth:   Width of the returned bitmap, usually but not always width + 2 * buffer\n//  sdfHeight\n```\n",
