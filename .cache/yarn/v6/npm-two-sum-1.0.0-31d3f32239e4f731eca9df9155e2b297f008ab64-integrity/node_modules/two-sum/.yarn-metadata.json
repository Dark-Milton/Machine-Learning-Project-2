Knuth.  \"The Art of Computer Programming: Seminumerical Algorithms\".  Volume 2.  1981\n\n## Install\nUsing npm:\n\n\t\tnpm install two-sum\n\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar twoSum = require(\"two-sum\")\n\n//Add two wildly different sized floats\nvar result = twoSum(1e64, 1e-64)\nconsole.log(result)\n\n//Prints:\n//  [1e-64, 1e64]\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `require(\"two-sum\")(a, b[, result])`\nComputes a non-overlapping sequence representing the sum of a and b.\n\n* `a` is a number\n* `b` is a number\n* `result` is an optional length 2 array encoding the result of the sum of `a` and `b`\n\n**Returns** A length 2 array representing the non-overlapping sequence encoding the sum of a and b.  The first term has smaller magnitude than the second.\n\n## Credits\nBased on an idea from JRS robust geometric predicates paper.\n\nImplementation (c) 2013 Mikola Lysenko.  MIT License",
