    "readme": "# canvas-fit [![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)\n\nSmall module for fitting a canvas element within the bounds of its parent.\nUseful, for example, for making a canvas fill the screen. Works with SVG\nelements too!\n\n## Usage\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/canvas-fit.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/canvas-fit/)\n\n### resize = fit(canvas[, parent[, scale]])\n\nCreates a `resize` function for your `canvas` element. Calling this function\nwill resize the canvas to fit its parent element.\n\nHere's a simple example to make your canvas update its dimensions when\nresizing the window:\n\n``` javascript\nvar fit = require('canvas-fit')\nvar canvas = document.createElement('canvas')\n\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', fit(canvas), false)\n```\n\nYou might want to override the `parent` element that the canvas should be\nfitting within: in which case, pass that element in as your second argument:\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('resize'\n  , fit(canvas, window)\n  , false\n)\n```\n\nYou can also set the scale of the canvas element relative to its styled size\non the page using the `scale` argument â€“ for example, passing in\n`window.devicePixelRatio` here will scale the canvas resolution up on retina\ndisplays.\n\n\n### `resize.scale = <Number>`\n\nDynamically change the canvas' target `scale`. Note that you still need to\nmanually trigger a resize after doing this.\n\n\n### `resize.parent = <DOMElement>`\n\nDynamically change the canvas' `parent` element. Note that you still need\nto manually trigger a resize after doing this.\n\n### `resize.parent = () => [width, height]`\n\nInstead of filling a given element, explicitly set the width and height\nof the canvas. Note that this value will still be scaled up according\nto `resize.scale`\n\n``` javascript\nresize.parent = function() {\n  return [ window.innerWidth - 300, window.innerHeight ]\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
