    "readme": "# right-now [![stable](http://hughsk.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/hughsk/stability-badges) #\n\nGet the quickest, most high-resolution timestamp possible in node or the\nbrowser.\n\nInstead of returning the date, `right-now` may use `performance.now`,\n`Date.now`, `+new Date` or `process.hrtime` to get a timestamp suitable for\nmeasuring intervals of time. Handy for both animation loops and precision\nbenchmarking.\n\nIt's pretty small but saves me writing this boilerplate every time :)\n\n## Installation ##\n\n``` bash\nnpm install right-now\n```\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### `require('right-now')()` ###\n\nReturns a timestamp. In node, this uses `process.hrtime`. In the browser,\nsupport for the following is checked in this order:\n\n* `performance.now()`\n* `Date.now()`\n* `+new Date`\n",
