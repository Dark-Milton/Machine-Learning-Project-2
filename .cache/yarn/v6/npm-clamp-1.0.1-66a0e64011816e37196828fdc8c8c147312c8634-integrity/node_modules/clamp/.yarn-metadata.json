It's as simple as modules come - saving\nkeystrokes because I've had to write this function too many times.\n\n## Usage ##\n\n[![clamp](https://nodei.co/npm/clamp.png?mini=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/clamp)\n\n### `clamp(value, a, b)` ###\n\nReturns `value`, if it is between `a` and `b`. Otherwise, returns the number\nit's gone past.\n\n## License ##\n\nMIT. See [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/hughsk/clamp/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
