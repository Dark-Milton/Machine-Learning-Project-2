The iterator is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* **callback(err, results)** - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the transformed items from the original array.\n\n## License ##\n\nMIT. See [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/hughsk/map-limit/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
