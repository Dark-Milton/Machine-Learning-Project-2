    "readme": "gl-pointcloud2d\n============\nWebGL 2D point cloud for lots of points\n\n## Example\n... to be created\n\n## Install\nUsing [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/), you can install this module as follows:\n\n```\nnpm i gl-pointcloud2d\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Constructor\n\n#### `var pointcloud = require('gl-pointcloud2d')(plot, options)`\nCreates a new 2D point cloud.\n\n* `plot` is a reference to a `gl-plot2d` object\n* `options` is a JSON object containing the parameters which are passed to the object when it is updated.\n\n`options` has the following properties:\n\n* `data` is a packed 2*n length array of the unrolled xy coordinates of the points (required) - buffering is significantly faster if it's of type Float32Array\n* `idToIndex` is an optional array of length n where `idToIndex[i] = i` - buffering is significantly faster if it's supplied and of type Int32Array\n* `color` is the color of a marker as a length 4 RGBA array (default `[1,0,0,1]`)\n* `borderSize` is the ratio of the border around each point (default `0`)\n* `borderColor` is the color of the border of each point (default `[0,0,0,1]`)\n* `blend` determines if `gl` blending is enabled for a translucency effect on overlaps; enabling it lowers draw speed somewhat (default `false`)\n\n**Returns** A new point cloud plot object, which is also registered to `plot`\n\n### Methods\n\n#### `pointcloud.update(options)`\nUpdates the point cloud plot.\n\n* `options` is an object with the same properties as in the point cloud plot constructor\n\n#### `pointcloud.dispose()`\nDestroys the point cloud plot and all associated resources.\n\n## License\n(c) 2015 Mikola Lysenko.
