The first entry is the lower order bits, and the second entry is the upper order bits.\n\n**Note** This algorithm does not work correctly with denormalized numbers.\n\n## Credits\nJavaScript implementation (c) 2013-2014 Mikola Lysenko.  Based on ideas from Jonathan Shewchuk's [robust adaptive geometric predicates](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html).",
