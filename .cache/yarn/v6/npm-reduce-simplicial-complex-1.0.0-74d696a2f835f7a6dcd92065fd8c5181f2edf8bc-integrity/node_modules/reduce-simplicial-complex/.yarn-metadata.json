    "readme": "reduce-simplicial-complex\n=========================\nGiven an oriented simplicial complex, this module computes a minimal basis for the complex in the integer homology sense.  That is, it cancels out all pairs of equivalent cells which have opposite orientation.\n\n# Example\n\n```javascript\nvar reduceCells = require('reduce-simplicial-complex')\n\nvar cells = [\n  [1, 2, 3],\n  [2, 1, 3],\n  [3, 2, 1],\n  [4, 5, 6],\n  [7, 8]\n]\n\nconsole.log(reduceCells(cells))\n```\n\n# Install\n\n```\nnpm i reduce-simplicial-complex\n```\n\n# API\n\n#### `require('reduce-simplicial-complex')(cells)`\nCancels all pairs of oppositely oriented cells\n\n* `cells` is an array of cells\n\n**Returns** A collapsed list of cells\n\n**Note** This is done in place.  If you need a copy, you should make a copy first, for example using `cells.slice()`.\n\n# License\n(c) 2015 Mikola Lysenko. MIT License\n",
